% *** ABSTRACT ***


\begin{abstract}
In this review, five research papers from 2015 to 2017 were selected from the ACM and IEEE Xplore digital libraries by using journal citation reports, search queries, and manual selection criteria. These five papers were summarized for a range of commonly used hyperparameter optimization methods and their performance in experimental settings. It was found that the most effective hyperparameter optimization methods used the Sequential Model Based Optimization (SMBO) framework with hyperparameter initialization techniques and incorporation of conditional spaces. However, hyperparameter optimization techniques are heavily reliant on the machine learning algorithms and datasets used, which leads to issues in dimensionality and inconsistent results. Proposed future work included implementing improved sampling techniques, and combining machine learning models with hyperparameter optimization methods for automated machine learning.
